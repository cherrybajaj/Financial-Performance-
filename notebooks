#Financial Performance Report (Past 5 Years): Apple vs Microsoft vs Alphabet 

Companies: Apple(AAPL), Microsoft(MSFT), Alphabet(GOOG)
Window: Last 5 year fiscal years available in the dataset
Objectives: Compare growth, profitability, cash generation, and balance-sheet strength across the three firms.

# Questions this notebook answers 
1.Which company grew fastest (Revenue, NetIncome, FCF)?
2.Which company generates the best profitability (Margins)?
3.Which company looks safest from a balance-sheet view (Net cash, leverage)?

End-to-end workflow
## End-to-end workflow (what I did)

1. **Acquire data**
   - Pulled annual financial statement line items for AAPL / MSFT / GOOG.
   - Standardized the fiscal-year label to the statement end-date year.

2. **Clean & standardize**
   - Converted all numeric fields to numeric dtype.
   - Standardized sign conventions (especially CapEx, if needed).
   - Ensured consistent column names across companies.

3. **Engineer metrics (KPIs)**
   - Computed margins and return/leverage ratios.
   - Computed YoY growth and 5-year growth measures (where applicable).

4. **Compare companies**
   - Produced a snapshot comparison table (latest fiscal year).
   - Produced trend charts for growth/profitability/leverage.

5. **Interpretation**
   - Summarized “who wins” and added caveats (fiscal year alignment, buybacks affecting ROE, etc.).

Data details

## Data acquisition

**source:** (yfinance / SEC fillings / annual reports)
**Frequency** Annual(last 5 years available)

**Why annual?**
- Annual data is simpler to align across companies and avoids quarter-to-quarter noise.

**Important cavest**
- Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet have different fiscal year ends, so "FY2024" does not represent the same calendar window across companies.

Data definition

## Dataset used

This notebook uses `data/financials_annual.csv` with one row per **company x fiscal_year**.

**columns**
- **Income statement:** `revenue`, `gross_profit`, `net_income`, `net_profit_margin`

- **Cash Flow:** `fcf` (Free Cash Flow)

- **Balance sheet:** `total_liabilities`,`shareholders_equity`, `total_assets`, `debt_to_equity`

- **Returns:** `roe` (Return on Equity)

**Note**
-Fiscal year ends differ: Apple(~Sep), Microsoft (~Jun), Alphabet (~Dec).
-Comparisons are still meaningful, but fiscl years do not algin perfectly to the same calendar months.

KPI Layer (Metric definitions)

## Metric definitions (how we calculate things)

- **YoY growth (Revenue / Net Income / FCF)**
\[
\text{YoY}= /frac{X_{t-1}}{X_{t-1}}
\]

- **Net Profit Margin**
\[
\text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}}
\]

-**ROE (Return on Equity)**
\[
\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}    
\]

-**Debt-to-Equity**
\[
\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}    
\]
(If your dataset uses total liabilities instead of total debt, note that it will overstate leverage.)

-**Net cash (if available)**
\[
\text{Net Cash} = \text{Cash \& Equivalents} - \text{Total Debt}  
\]

Results plan

## Analysis plan 
1. **Data sanity checks** (missing values, outliners, sign conventions)
2. **KPI table** (latest year snapshot + 5-year CAGR)
3. **Trend plots** (Revenue, Net Income, FCF, Margins, ROE, leverage)
4. **Conclusions** (who wins on growth, profitability, safety)

Finding skeleton

## Findings 

- **Growth:** MSFT Net margin 36.1% > GOOG 28.6% > APPL 24.0%
- **Profitability:** MSFT:Best profitability(36%) with strong ROE~33% and high quality earnings, balanced sheet.
- **Capital efficieny(ROE):** ROE reality check: AAPL 157% is inflated by a tiny equity base from massive buybacks and not economically comparable.

## Limitations

- **Fiscal year mismatch:** FY labels do not represent the same calendar months across companies.
- **Accounting differences:** Business models differ (ads/software/hardware), so margins are structurally different.
- **Data-source mapping:** Some line-items may be missing or renamed depending on source; this can affect debt/equity and cash definitions.
- **ROE distortion:** Equity shrinkage (buybacks) can inflate ROE; it should not be used alone.

## How to Reproduce

1.Open and run the main notebook: `/<Your_Main_Notebook>.ipynb`
2.Confirm the dataset exists: `/data/financials_annual.csv`
3.Run the KPI + plotting cells to regenrate the figures/tables.
